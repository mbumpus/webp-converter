## 🏗️ How It Was Built

This utility was developed using [Crewly Codes](https://crewly.codes), an AI Product Manager that orchestrates multi-persona crews with full governance and transparency.

### The Process

**1. Morgan (AI Product Manager)** - Generated spec (2 min)
- Created user stories with acceptance criteria
- Defined success metrics
- Identified technical constraints (privacy-first, client-side only)

**2. Dev Crew** - Built the application (6 min)
- AIAgentDeveloper created HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Used Canvas API for client-side conversion
- Implemented drag-and-drop, quality controls, real-time preview
- Privacy-first architecture (no server needed)

**3. QA Engineer** - Validated quality (< 1 min)
- Tested against all acceptance criteria
- No issues found (perfect first try)
- Approved for Product Manager review

**4. Product Manager** - Approved for release (< 1 min)
- Reviewed QA validation
- Confirmed all acceptance criteria met
- Approved with 95% confidence

**Total:** 8 minutes, $0.56, zero production bugs

## 🤖 Built With Governed AI

This utility demonstrates the **Cabinet Method** - a framework for governed AI development:

### The Governance Framework

- ✅ **Multi-persona orchestration** - Different AI roles (PM, Dev, QA) with specific responsibilities
- ✅ **Structured handoffs** - Clear context transfer between personas
- ✅ **Blocking authority** - QA can reject builds with evidence requirements
- ✅ **Complete audit trails** - Every decision logged with reasoning and confidence
- ✅ **Human oversight gates** - Critical decisions require human validation

### Why This Matters

Traditional AI coding tools run autonomously and hope for the best. Crewly Codes puts humans at every critical decision point:

1. **Morgan generates specs** → YOU approve them
2. **AI crew builds code** → YOU watch and validate
3. **QA evaluates quality** → YOU provide evidence
4. **PM decides to ship** → YOU make the final call

**Full transparency. Complete control. Real governance.**
